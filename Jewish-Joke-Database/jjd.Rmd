This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
require(RCurl)
require(XML)
url<-"http://www.awordinyoureye.com/"
webpage <- getURL(url)
webpage <- readLines(tc <- textConnection(webpage)); 
close(tc)

mainPage <- htmlTreeParse(webpage, error=function(...){}, useInternalNodes = TRUE)
#links = xpathApply(mainPage, "//a[@href]", xmlGetAttr, "href")
#links

links = xpathApply(mainPage, "//a[@href]", xmlGetAttr, "href")
links

#tableNodes = getNodeSet(mainPage, "//table")
# Trim first three tables

tableNodes

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
