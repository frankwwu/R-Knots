* Data source: https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21280272/orcs.pdf

* I have tried using Python with camelot, but it was too slow to complete. 

```{r}
library(pdftools)
```

```{r}
ds <- pdf_text('https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21280272/orcs.pdf')
length(ds)
```

```{r}
pages <- strsplit(ds, '\n')
head(pages)
```
