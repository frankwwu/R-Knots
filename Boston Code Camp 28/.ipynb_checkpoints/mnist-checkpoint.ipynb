This is because we're solving an entire optimisation problem each time we want to generate an image.\n",

When this transformation network is trained on many images given a fixed style image, we end up with a fully feed-forward CNN that we can apply for style transfer. This gives us a 1000x speed up over this implementation, making it suitable for a the *Stylist* webapp.\n",
